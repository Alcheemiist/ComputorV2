# Project Overview

The Computor-v2 project aims to develop a powerful mathematical interpreter designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations and types. The interpreter will function like a command-line tool, accepting user inputs to perform complex computations and algebraic manipulations. This project serves as a foundation for more advanced mathematical projects, providing essential tools and features for solving equations and manipulating variables.

## Core Objectives

- **Mathematical Capabilities:** The interpreter must support comple-x numbers, real numbers, matrices, and polynomial equations (up to degree 2).
- **Type Handling:** Variables can be assigned, reassigned, and inferred based on mathematical expressions, with seamless transitions between types (rational, complex, matrix, etc.).
- **Expression and Equation Solving:** The program will resolve both simple and complex mathematical expressions, including solving polynomial equations of degree â‰¤ 2.
- **Functionality:** The interpreter should allow defining and manipulating functions, supporting operations such as evaluation and function composition.
- **User Interface:** The program will act as an interactive shell, enabling users to input mathematical expressions and retrieve results while maintaining computation priorities and history.

## Bonus Features

- Advanced function curve displays
- Additional mathematical functions (e.g., exponential, trigonometry)
- Matrix inversion and vector computations
- Function composition and command history tracking
- This project is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of mathematical concepts while building an efficient and extensible interpreter without relying on external libraries for complex number or matrix management
