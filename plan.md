# Core Objectives

## Mathematical Knowledge: The program must enable you to work with:

- [ ] Complex numbers
- [ ] Real numbers
- [ ] Matrices
- [ ] Function theory
- [ ] Polynomial equations (degrees ≤ 2)

## Type Handling and Operations: The interpreter should support:

- [ ] Rational numbers
- [ ] Complex numbers (with rational coefficients)
- [ ] Matrices
- [ ] Polynomial equations (degree ≤ 2)

## Variable Management: It should allow

- [ ] Assignment of expressions to variables with type inference.
- [ ] Reassignment of variables, including changing the type.
- [ ] Assignment of one variable to another.

## Expression Resolution: The interpreter must

- [ ] Solve mathematical expressions with or without predefined variables.
- [ ] Solve polynomial equations (degree ≤ 2).
- [ ] Handle operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulos, and matrix multiplication.

## Function Support: It should

- [ ] Define functions with one variable.
- [ ] Support operations on functions, including evaluation.

## User Interface: The program should behave like a shell, retrieving user inputs for

- [ ] Performing computations
- [ ] Handling parentheses and computation priorities
- [ ] Additional Features
- [ ] Managing conventional operations (+, -, *, /) and modulo.
- [ ] Exponentiation (^) for integer and positive powers.
- [ ] Displaying results and computation history.

## Bonus Objectives (if mandatory parts are fully implemented)

- [ ] Displaying function curves.
- [ ] Supporting advanced mathematical functions (e.g., exponentials, trigonometry).
- [ ] Composition of functions.
- [ ] Matrix inversion, vector computation.
- [ ] Tracking command history.

This project will test both the ability to implement complex mathematical operations and the design skills in creating a flexible, extensible interpreter without using external libraries for complex number or matrix management
